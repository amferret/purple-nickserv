purple-nickserv
===============

A slightly less cheap auto-ident plugin for nickserv.

You compile it with scons so get that I guess.

It just adds fields in advanced config for IRC accounts. 
Identifies you in the background, blocks Nickserv messages, passwords etc.
Just set your desired nick and specify a NickServ password.

I didn't use the account name because it gets changed by the IRC plugin every time your nick is forced to be an alt.
Didn't use the existing "Ghost nicknames" option because it might actually work some day so it's not my business.
